## TODO

- Add a sword in a chest

- Add abillity to kill a dragon

- Add health points that you lose and restore



This is just a fun project where we move a 2D character through a level.
The character must open gates with keys or switches.
The character may defeat enemies that are weaker.
There might be a health bar.

## TODO

Quinn says it would be really cool to have a level with 8 doors, and you pick a door, and you have to fight the boss of that room.  Once you defeat 3 rooms, you can move on.  BUT if you defeat like 5 of them, another door would unlock with a chest in it!
